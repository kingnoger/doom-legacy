smite-meister's log for Legacy 2

Started: 2010-03-23


*** vsprintf fixes (same as Legacy 1 commit 608)
rev 616
Replaced a number of unsafe uses of vsprintf with vsnprintf, fixing
several console-related crashing bugs.
Added this log.


*** ENDOOM fixed (from legacy_one commit 688)
rev 704
Now the ENDOOM lump has current information in it.
Also, updated compiling docs.



TODO
- when deleting global vars (caches, namely) after exit() has been called, texture_cache and material_cache have some unwanted interplay (default texture)
