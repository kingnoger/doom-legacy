*** vsprintf fixes (same as Legacy 1 commit 608)
rev 616
Replaced a number of unsafe uses of vsprintf with vsnprintf, fixing
several console-related crashing bugs.
Added this log.


*** ENDOOM fixed (from legacy_one commit 688)
rev 704
Now the ENDOOM lump has current information in it.
Also, updated compiling docs.
