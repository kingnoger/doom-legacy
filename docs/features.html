<h1>Doom Legacy features</h1>

<p />
As of version XXX, the Legacy game engine has been rewritten in
C++. A host of features were added to the game. Here is a short
summary.

<p />
*   Implemented but doesn't affect the game yet.<br />
**  Partly implemented

<h2>Graphics</h2>

<ul>
 <li>** general graphic presentations, MD3 support
</ul>

<h2>Sound and Music</h2>

<p />
The preferred multimedia interface is now SDL, the Simple DirectMedia
Layer. This makes Legacy easily portable and offers great multimedia
capabilities. Music is produced using the SDL_mixer
library. Highlights:

<ul>
 <li>Supports MUS, MIDI, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis music
 <li>Original Doom and **WAV sounds
 <li>Software 3D sound renderer
</ul>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p />
Gameplay is nearly the same as in original Doom/Heretic. However, if
required, it can be enhanced with the following features:

<ul>
 <li>Advanced teamplay. Deathmatch, co-op, team deathmatch...
 <li>Weapon groups á la Half-Life
 <li>Any creature can be played, not just Marines or Heretics
 <li>Customizable HUD (using HUD widgets)
</ul>


<h2>Editing</h2>

<p />
The Doom map format is bad. It is hard to expand and relies in many
cases on properties hard-coded in the original Doom executable.
Things were improved a bit by Hexen, which extended the Doom map
format and added the MAPINFO lump, which can be used to create a
custom map ordering within the WAD.

<p />
Legacy improved the map format further by introducing the
<a href="#MapInfo">MapInfo</a> (or LevelInfo) lumps. They are stored
in the map separator (mapname) lump, which is normally empty. Each map
can have its own MapInfo.

<p />
The WAD datafile format itself is somewhat constricting, mainly due to
the 8 character lumpnames and lack of internal directory structure.
This has been remedied in the WAD2/WAD3, PAK and PK3 datafile formats.

<ul>
 <li>MapInfo lumps
 <li>Hexen/ZDoom-style MAPINFO support
 <li>WAD2/WAD3 support
 <li>** PAK and PK3 support
</ul>


<h2>Other new features</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Autoexpanding Zone Memory system. Never run out of memory, until
 you REALLY run out of memory.
 <li>Second level dedicated cache system for sounds *etc.
 <li>* Can run several maps simultaneously
 <li>New game objects with custom AI are easy to make through inheritance
 <li>Level ordering is free, one level can in principle have any number
of exits that lead to different levels.
 <li>Damage system with different types of damage
 <li>** DLL modifiability
</ul>


<hr />

<a name="MapInfo"><h1>MapInfo lump structure</h1></a>

The MapInfo lump is plain ASCII text and consists of
<i>blocks</i>. Each block begins with
<pre>
[this is a blockname]&lt;\n&gt;
</pre>
and ends when the next block begins, or when the lump ends.

<p />
The recognized blocknames are
[map info] / [level info]

[scripts]

[intertext]

<!-- [mapformat] -->
