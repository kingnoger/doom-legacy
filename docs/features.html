<h1>Doom Legacy features</h1>

<p>
As of version 2.0, the Legacy game engine has been rewritten in
C++. A host of features were added to the game. Here is a short
summary.
</p>
<p>
*   Nearly complete<br/>
**  Partly implemented<br/>
*** In a planning stage
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>

<ul>
 <li>* A brand new OpenGL graphics engine.</li>
 <li>Support for v2 and v5 GL nodes and glVIS.
 <li>Hi-res sprites/textures/flats, PNG and JPEG/JFIF support.</li>
 <li>Generic graphic presentations for game objects. Support for sprites, **MD2s and MD3s.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sound and Music</h2>

<p>
The preferred multimedia interface is now SDL, the Simple DirectMedia
Layer. This makes Legacy easily portable and offers great multimedia
capabilities. Music is produced using the SDL_mixer
library. Highlights:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Supports MUS, MIDI, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis music, as well as various
 module formats.</li>
 <li>Original Doom and WAV/RIFF sounds.</li>
 <li>Software 3D sound renderer.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>
Gameplay is nearly the same as in original Doom/Heretic/Hexen. However, if
required, it can be enhanced with the following features:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>**Completely new netcode using OpenTNL.</li>
 <li>Advanced teamplay. Deathmatch, co-operative, *** capture the
 flag, *** domination, *** assault.</li>
 <li>Client-side bots (as **DLLs?).</li>
 <li>Asynchronous map changes, several maps can be run simultaneously.</li>
 <li>Level hubs (it's possible to return to a previously visited map).</li>
 <li>All weapons from Doom/Heretic/Hexen usable in any game type if you
 supply the required graphics and sounds! Weapon groups á la Half-Life.</li>
 <li>**Any creature can be played, not just Marines or Heretics.</li>
 <li>**Customizable HUD (using HUD widgets).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Editing</h2>

<ul>
 <li>LevelInfo lumps.</li>
 <li>Hexen/ZDoom-style MAPINFO support, with extensions. Free level
 ordering, hubs á la Hexen.</li>
 <li>Partial DECORATE support (Actors).</li>
 <li>SNDINFO and SNDSEQ support, with extensions.</li>
 <li>ANIMDEFS support.</li>
 <li>Supported datafile formats: WAD, WAD2/3, PAK, ZIP/PK3.</li>
 <li>Normal directories can be used as resource "files".</li>
 <li>Essential DeHackEd and BEX support with extensions.</li>
 <li>Cross-over games: Doom/Heretic/Hexen entities in the same level,
  players playing Hellspawn instead of Marines...</li>
 <li>Voodoo dolls finally work.</li>
 <li>Internal BLOCKMAP builder enables ridiculously huge maps.</li>
 <li>*** DLL modifiability.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other new features of interest (mainly for programmers)</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Zone Memory system replaced with malloc/free. No more fiddling with -mb.</li>
 <li>Second level dedicated cache system for textures, sounds, sprites etc.</li>
 <li>New game objects with custom AI are easy to make through inheritance.</li>
 <li>New save/load system with zlib compression.</li>
 <li>Damage system with different types of damage.</li>
 <li>Beautiful Doxygen documentation of the source code.</li>
</ul>
