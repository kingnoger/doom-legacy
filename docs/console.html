<h2><a name="1">Console basics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="1-1">Console usage</a></h3>

<p>With Doom Legacy's console, you will be able to change a lot of
parameters within the game, and customise the game to your preferences.
The console is simply a command prompt, where you can enter commands
and change the values of game variables.
Since the first game console we know of was from Id Software's game Quake,
we have been inspired by this console, and have tried to use the same
functionality for the Quake-Doom fans.

<p>To open the console, press the <b>console key</b>. It is located just
below ESC. You can set the console key at the Setup Controls
menu.
To exit the console, either press again the console key, or press
<b>ESC</b>, which will bring up the menu, and shut the console.

<p>The console displays all messages from the game. You can go back in
the messages with key <b>PAGE UP</b>, and go down with the key <b>PAGE
DOWN</b>. Press the key <b>HOME</b> to jump to the oldest message in the
console text
buffer, and key <b>END</b> to jump to the last output message (the most
recent).

<p>The last lines of the console text buffer are displayed at the top
of the screen, when the console is off. That is, you can see 5 lines
of messages instead of only 1 in the original Doom. You can change
the duration of display of the messages with the console variable
<a href="#con_hudtime">con_hudtime</a>, see the commands section for more.


<h3><a name="1-2">Console input</a></h3>

<p>While the console is on, it accepts typed-in commands.
Press <b>ENTER</b> to execute the command.
For convenience, you have a history of the last 32 commands entered.
Press <b>UP ARROW</b> to go back in the commands history, <b>DOWN ARROW</b> to
go forward.

<p>Another very useful key is the <b>TAB</b> key: it completes a command
or variable name that has not been fully entered.
This is a very good way to see the existing commands: just
enter any letter, then press <b>TAB</b> several times to see what commands
are available.

<div class="example">
The variables to customize the console itself usually start
with 'con_', thus typing 'con' and pressing the 'TAB' key several times
will display the following console variables : 'con_height', 'con_speed',
'con_hudtime', 'con_backpic'...
</div>

<p>You can also press <b>SHIFT-TAB</b>, which will complete the command line,
but in reverse order.


<h3><a name="1-3">Commands and variables</a></h3>

<p>Basically, a <b>command</b> does not have a value, and is not saved to the
configuration file. A <b>variable</b> always has an associated value, for
example the variable 'name' holds your name as a player.

<p>Entering a command without any parameters will usually tell you
the command syntax.

<div class="example">
map<br/>
Usage: map &lt;number|name&gt; [&lt;entrypoint&gt;]: warp players to a map.
</div>

<p>Entering a variable name alone will tell you the current
value of the variable.

<div class="example">
name<br/>
"name" is "gi joe"
</div>

<p>To set the value of a variable, give the new value as a
parameter. When the value has blanks in it, use double quotes
around it.
For example, to change your name to 'dj fab', type

<div class="example">
name "dj fab"
</div>

<p>Boolean variables (true/false, yes/no) use '0' to denote false.
Any nonzero value means true.


<h3><a name="1-4">Configuration files</a></h3>

<p>Most variables are automatically saved to the default configuration
file <b>config.cfg</b>. Like in the original Doom, the <a href="legacy.html#config">-config</a>
parameter will set explicitly the configuration file to use.
Thus, you can have default settings for different persons, using
different configuration files.
While the configuration files support any commands, and are executed
like a script, you should not edit them, because they are always overwritten
when the game exits.


<h3><a name="1-5">Autoexec.cfg</a></h3>

<p>The <b>autoexec.cfg</b> file is a text 'script' file which is automatically
executed at the game startup, if it is found.
You can edit autoexec.cfg to set the values of those variables
that are not automatically saved to 'config.cfg'. You can also add
commands that will be executed one after another, just like a script.

<p>Comments start with <b>//</b>.
Each line of the autoexec.cfg file is like a line that you would have
typed at the console. Here are some examples:

<p>This sample 'autoexec.cfg' will warp you to map 01 as soon as the
game is loaded:

<div class="example"><pre>
// start always with map1, without waiting at the menu
map map01
echo "welcome to map 01"   //useless comment
</pre></div>

<p>Another example, here we set the variables that are not saved to the
config.cfg, because they are not considered 'standard' parameters:

<div class="example"><pre>
// set my preferred weird game mode
bloodtime 5   // blood lasts 5 seconds
fastmonsters 1
teamdamage 1
map map07
echo "bigjim's weird mode active"
</pre></div>

<p>In the last example, each time you start the game, it will set the
variables like <a href="#bloodtime">bloodtime</a> that are not
normally saved to config.cfg.
Just look at config.cfg to know which variables are saved.


<h3><a name="1-6">Script files</a></h3>

<p>config.cfg and autoexec.cfg are script files. It means they
contain commands and variables that are executed in sequence.
You can create any number of script files, and execute them from the console
using the <a href="#exec">exec</a> command.

<p>For example, to start a script named 'blood.cfg' just enter
<div class="example">
exec blood.cfg
</div>

<h2><a name="2">Console commands and variables</a></h2>

<p>This chapter describes all console commands and variables in Doom
Legacy.
Many console variables are also available through the menu.
You will need to use the console only if you want to customise the
game more to your needs.


<h3><a name="2-1">Basic commands</a></h3>

<p>Here are the basic commands for script execution. They have the same
usage and functionality as in the game Quake.
You can use a <b>semicolon</b> to separate several commands in the same line.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>command</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>alias &lt;aliasname&gt; &lt;command&gt;</td>
<td>
When you type 'aliasname', it will be like if you had
entered 'command'. Let's have an example:
<div class="example">
alias silence "soundvolume 0; musicvolume 0"
</div>
When you will type 'silence', it will execute the
corresponding command. In this example, we have given two
commands as one, inside " ", and using the semicolon as a separator
for commands.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>echo &lt;"text"&gt;</td>
<td>Just echoes (prints) the text to console.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a name="exec">exec</a> &lt;filename&gt;</td>
<td>
Execute a script file. A script file is just a text file
containing a sequence of commands or variables. Script files
usually have a '.cfg' extension. Example:
<div class="example">
exec autoexec.cfg
</div>
will execute all the commands in autoexec.cfg
</td></tr>

<tr><td>help [&lt;variable&gt;]</td>
<td>
Shows a list of all the console commands and variables.<br/>
If given a variable name, shows detailed info on that variable.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>toggle &lt;variable&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]</td>
<td>Without the 'value' parameter this toggles a variable, i.e. changes
it to the next possible value.<br/>
With the 'value' parameter it adds 'value' to the variable.
<p>This command is very useful for use with <a href="#bind">bind</a>. Example:
<div class="example">
bind "&gt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity"<br/>
bind "&lt;" "toggle gr_fogdensity -1"
</div>
so you can modify fogdensity without going into the console or menu!
</td></tr>

<tr><td>wait [&lt;ticks&gt;]</td>
<td>Wait a given amount of time before the next command is executed.
The unit is 1/35 s. Example: this will wait 5 seconds, then display 'ok!'
<div class="example">
wait 175; echo "ok!"
</div>
</td></tr>


<tr><td><a name="bind">bind</a> &lt;keyname&gt; &lt;"command"&gt;</td>
<td>Bind commands to a key. Each time you press the key,
the commands will be executed. Example:
<div class="example">
&gt; bind s screenshot
</div>
Now each time you push the 's' key the game will save a screenshot.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>cls</td>
<td>Clear the console text buffer.</td></tr>


<tr><td>keymap [&lt;language&gt;]</td>
<td>
Change the keyboard map. Currently we support English (qwerty) and
French (azerty) keyboards. If you omit the language, the game will
default to qwerty.
</td></tr>

</table>


<h3><a name="2-2">Console setup</a></h3>

<p>These variables control the look and feel of the console.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>con_backpic</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
1: use an opaque console background picture (in lump CONSBACK), like in Quake.<br/>
0: use a translucent LCD-like console background.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>con_height</td><td>int</td>
<td>
How many percent of the total screen height the console
will use. E.g. con_height 50 (the default) will use half the
screen height for the console.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>con_speed</td><td>int</td>
<td>
The speed (in pixels/tick) at which the console comes down or moves out of
the screen when you press the console toggle key.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a name="con_hudtime">con_hudtime</a></td><td>int</td>
<td>
The number of seconds messages stay on the top
of the screen. They are 5 message lines that scroll as soon
as new messages arrive. E.g. con_hudtime 5, which is the
default, will make the messages stay for 5 seconds before
disappearing. Set this to 0, and you will never see any
messages out of the console (HUD means heads-up display).
</td></tr>

</table>





<h3><a name="2-3">Player setup</a></h3>

<p>These variables control your player avatar's appearance and your game
preferences. The splitscreenplayer has similar variables, but with the
number 2 appended to the variable name, e.g. 'color2 red' turns the
splitscreenplayer's avatar red.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>splitscreen</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/Disable the splitscreen. If necessary, this spawns a secondary
local player, called the 'splitscreenplayer'.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>name</td><td>string</td>
<td>
Enter your name as a player, for network games. Your name will
be seen when you send a message (chat key), and is displayed
in the deathmatch rankings. Use "" if the name contains spaces,
E.g.: name "dj fabbe"
</td></tr>

<tr><td>color &lt;0-10&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose your avatar's color.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>skin</td><td>string</td>
<td>
Change your skin, provided some skins are loaded (adding skins wads
after the -file on the command line). The default marine skin
name is 'marine'.
</td></tr>



<tr><td>autoaim</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
The original Doom used autoaiming in the vertical direction, and a
small aim adjustment in the horizontal.
Now that you can shoot up and down with the freelook, you can
play like a pro and set autoaim off.<br/>

NETWORK NOTE: in a multiplayer game, the SERVER can force
the autoaim off for all players with the command
<a href="#allowautoaim">allowautoaim</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>originalweaponswitch</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Choose whether to use the original weapon change method (1), or
the new Preferred Weapons Order (0), see
<a href="#weaponpref">weaponpref</a> for more.<br/>

With the original weapon switch, whenever you walk on a weapon,
it will switch to that weapon, even if it is not as powerful
as the one you are carrying. That can be sometimes very
annoying, especially in fast deathmatches.
</td></tr>


<tr><td><a name="weaponpref">weaponpref</a></td><td>string</td>
<td>
The Preferred Weapons Order.<br/>
This works only if you have set 'originalweaponswitch' to '0'.

<p>You give a priority to each of the weapons, with a number digit
from '0' to '9'. Several weapons can have the same priority.
When you pickup a weapon that you don't already have, you
will switch to that weapon IF AND ONLY IF that weapon's priority
is greater that the one you are carrying. If you already had the
weapon, you will pickup the ammo as usual, without changing
weapon.
The numbers are priority values, for each of the weapons, in
the following order:

<p>Fist, Chainsaw, Gun, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Chaingun, Rocket launcher, Plasma, BFG.

<p>Thus 'weaponpref "021485763"' means that the super shotgun has
the highest priority (8), while the fist is lowest priority (0).
After the double shotgun, in decreasing priority you have the
rocket launcher (7), plasma gun (6), chaingun (5), shotgun (4),
BFG (3), chainsaw (2), gun  (1).

<p>Let's have another interesting example: 'weaponpref "333333333"'

<p>Since all weapons have the same priority in this last example,
you will in fact NEVER change weapon automatically, because
no weapon has a priority higher than any other one. You might
consider this as the 'manual' weapon change.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>crosshair &lt;0-3&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose whether to use a crosshair (1-3), or not (0). The values
are 1,2,3 for white cross, green angle, and red point.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>showmessages &lt;0-2&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
'0' means never show any messages on the screen, '1' means
always show the messages, which is the default.

There is one more setting, '2' that can only be entered at
the console, it will show all messages except most of the
'picked up ...' style messages. Useful if you are tired of
the 'picked up ammo', 'picked up health bonus', etc. messages.
</td></tr>

</table>



<h3><a name="2-4">Player controls</a></h3>

<p>These variables control the way the game handles the players' input.
The splitscreenplayer has similar variables, but with the
number 2 appended to the variable name.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>autorun</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Set this to 1 to invert the 'run' key. You will always be running,
EXCEPT when you push the 'run' key.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>automlook</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
<p>You can use the 'freelook' (ability to look up and down) in two
modes: permanent or temporary.

<p>Setting this variable to '1' will set the freelook permanent.

<p>When 'automlook' is '0', you will need to hold the 'freelook'
key down while moving the mouse up and down. When releasing the key,
the view will always re-center. This is useful if you keep
firing rockets at your feet.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>use_mouse</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Setting 'use_mouse' to '0' will disable the mouse. The next time
you start the game, the mouse won't be detected.

Set 'use_mouse' to '1' to search for a mouse, and activate it.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>invertmouse</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Set invertmouse to '1' to invert the mouse y (up and down) axis.
This is for freelook only, you will look up, when moving the mouse
down (backward), and look down when moving mouse forward.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mousemove</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/disable mouse Y-axis for forward/backward movement.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>mousesensx</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Sets the mouse sensitivity in the X direction.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mousesensy</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Sets the mouse sensitivity in the Y direction.
</td></tr>

</table>


<p>These input variables are common to both local players.


<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>



<tr><td>controlperkey &lt;1|2&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
When set to 2 (several) you can bind more than one control to a key.
Otherwise binding a control to a key will remove the key's other
assignations.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mouse2port &lt;1|2|3|4&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Choose the port number of the secondary mouse for the
splitscreenplayer between COM1 to COM4.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>use_joystick</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/disable joystick support.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>joystickfreelook</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Enable/disable freelook with the joystick.
</td></tr>

</table>


The game controls can be defined using the setcontrol command.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>command</th><th>definition</th></tr>

<tr><td>setcontrol &lt;control&gt; &lt;key1&gt; [&lt;key2&gt;]</td>
<td>
<p>Binds a key/joystick button/mouse button to a
game control (forward, fire, use etc.).
The second keyname is optional. You can set it, and have
two keys attached to one game control. eg: have 'ARROW UP'
and 'MOUSE2' for 'forward'.

<p>When a key does not have a name, it uses a name of the
form 'KEYxxx' where xxx is the key code.
To learn the names of the keys, look for them at the Setup Controls menu.

<p>The control names are "forward","backward","strafe",
"straferight","strafeleft","speed","turnleft","turnright",
"fire","use","lookup","lookdown","centerview","mouseaiming",
"weapon1","weapon2", ... "weapon8","talkkey","scores",
"jump","console".

Example:
<div class="example">
setcontrol forward "keypad 8" "up arrow"
</div>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>setcontrol2 &lt;control&gt; &lt;key1&gt; [&lt;key2&gt;]</td>
<td>Same as setcontrol but for splitscreenplayer.
</td></tr>
</table>




<h3><a name="2-5">Game options</a></h3>

<p>Using these variables you can change may aspects of the game
itself. For obvious reasons, in a netgame only the server can change them.

<table class="def">
<tr><th>variable</th><th>type</th><th>definition</th></tr>




<tr><td>deathmatch &lt;0|1|2|3&gt;</td><td>int</td>
<td>
Set the game type

0 : no teams, usual deathmatch

1 : teamplay, using color to identify teams, players of the
    same color will be in the same team, the team name will
    be like 'red team' or 'yellow team'

2 : teamskin, using skins to identify teams, players who use
    the same skin will be in the same team, the team name will
    show as 'leprechaun team' or 'terminator team', according
    to the name of the skin

<td>
Decide whether members of the same team can hurt one another or
not. Real players always have teamdamage on.

can switch to their POV using the spy mode. Usually disabled in deathmatch.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>exitmode</td><td>int</td>
<td>
How do the map exits work?<br/>
0: Map exits are disabled. This is useful in multiplayer
so that the only way to exit the level is to reach the timelimit, fraglimit
or the server giving the exitlevel command.<br/>
1: Everyone exits the map when an exit is first activated.<br/>
2: Only the player activating an exit exits the map, others keep playing.<br/>
3: Nobody exits the map until EVERYONE has reached an exit.
</td></tr>


<tr><td>fraglimit</td><td>int</td>
<td>
When the limit is reached, the level exited and game goes to intermission.
Use 0 to disable.

of another, and you walk over them. Sometimes you can even
reach ledges where you couldn't go by climbing on corpses!
</td></tr>


<tr><td>allowjump</td><td>bool</td>
<td>
Choose whether jump is allowed or not. For those of you who
come from the planet 'NoJump' or have a limited sensory system
and couldn't survive a jump in the 3rd axis of our world,
you can disable the jump in single player too.<br/>
NOTE: Jumping is considered cheating in maps not designed for it,
especially in speedrunning.

<td>
Enable/disable emulation of the Quake1 bug known as "Rocket Jump".
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a name="allowautoaim">allowautoaim</a></td><td>bool</td>

OpenGL/Glide
===================

note: Those variables are only available in the Linux and Win32 version.
 All those variable's names start with the gr_ prefix.
 Not all those variables are effective in Glide mode.


gr_coronas &lt;On|Off&gt;
   Enable or disable coronas around lights and rocket.

gr_coronasize &lt;positive float value&gt;
   Adjust light coronas size on the screen, coronas is in the reality 
   caused by despertion of light in the eye the size of a coronas depand 
   on your screen size and your distance of your eye to screen. So you 
   can adjust it the get the more realistic effect or just to see more 
   bigger coronas :).

gr_dynamiclighting &lt;On|Off&gt;
   Dynamic lighting is way to render (on walls and planes) lights emit by
   missiles or BFG balls. Be aware it can be slow on low end PC.
   See also gr_mblighting.


gr_fog &lt;On|Off&gt;
Enable or disable the fog, default is On.


gr_fogcolor &lt;rrggbb&gt;
Change the RGB (in hexadecimal format) value of the fog. The
|default is set to 000000 (black, looks like the original
doom fog). For a grey fog, set the value to 707070 (for example).


gr_fogdensity &lt;1-?&gt;
Change the fog density. The default value is 500. I suggest you to
try different values to see the changes.


gr_fov &lt;1-179&gt;
FOV means Field Of View. If you set a value above 90 and gr_mlook
(see below) is "Off", then DooM Legacy set automatically gr_mlook
to "On". This is because FOV, with a value higher than 90 degrees,
needs this mode to work properly. You can use it for zooming:

Mandeep/FlynnT tips for zooming (see other commands/variables)
  alias psprites_on "playersprites 1"
  alias psprites_off "playersprites 0"
  alias zoom_in "set_zoom_out; psprites_off; gr_fov 80; wait 1;
  gr_fov 71; wait 1; gr_fov 62; wait 1; gr_fov 54;
  wait 1; gr_fov 46; wait 1; gr_fov 39; wait 1;
  gr_fov 32; wait 1; gr_fov 26; wait 1; gr_fov 20;
  wait 1; gr_fov 15; wait 1; gr_fov 10"
  alias set_zoom_out "bind n zoom_out"
  alias zoom_out "set_zoom_in; gr_fov 15; wait 1; gr_fov 20; wait 1;
   gr_fov 26; wait 1; gr_fov 32; wait 1; gr_fov 39;
   wait 1; gr_fov 46; wait 1; gr_fov 54; wait 1;
   gr_fov 62;  wait 1; gr_fov 71;  wait 1; gr_fov 80;
   psprites_on; wait 1; gr_fov 90"
  alias set_zoom_in "bind n zoom_in"
  bind n zoom_in

I suggest you to put this in the autoexec.cfg file. It allows you
to use the 'n' key for zooming in and out.


gr_gammaxxx (where xxx = red|green|blue) &lt;0-255&gt;
Those variables are used for changing the intensity of red, green or
blue. You can use them to make DooM Legacy brighter or darker if you
change all those variables with the same smaller or higher value.


gr_mblighting &lt;On|Off&gt;
It's the same as dynamic lighting, except it shows the lights emit
by balls throw by monsters.


gr_mlook &lt;Off|On|Full&gt;
gr_mlook command is there for fixing the "mlook" bug (when you look
up and down). The default value is On.

- The "Off" (or 0) should only use if you don't use full mlook.
- The "On" (or 1) is fast and fix most of the mlook bug, but walls
  behind you can be hidden if you look at nearly 90° (up or down).
  It shouldn't be a big issue for most of you and it's the
  recommended mode for low end pc.
- The "Full" (or 2) is exactly the same as "On" but it fix all the
  bugs and is a little slower for angle &gt; 45 degree.

The gr_mlook command has been "optimized" recently. That's why, when
you're aiming at an angle of 0, it acts like if gr_mlook was Off,
even if gr_mlook is set to On or Full, and thus it's faster. There
is something similar with angle less than 45: if you use gr_mlook
Full, it act like gr_mlook On.


gr_staticlighting &lt;On|Off&gt;
This is an experimental variable for now since it's not yet
optimized. I don't recommend you to use it, except if you have
the cream of the cream PC. It's ok for some maps, though.
