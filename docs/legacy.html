<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

Hello all Doom fans of the world, here is the latest release of
Doom LEGACY project by Team Legacy.

Well, if you are reading this you probably know by now that the
gods at IdSoftware have released the sources of the greatest game
on earth : Doom !!

Of course a lot of projects have started around the sources since
about January 1998, and Doom LEGACY is competing to be the best of
the choices!

We have always dreamed of Doom sources being released, and all the
features that we'd like to add. Since Doom1 was out we are fans
of deathmatching. Don't ask us why we like it more than Duke Nukem
or other clones, we like the atmosphere of Doom and its like that!

This new version of Doom is not commercial anymore, but you should
have the original Doom data (either doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad or 
plutonia.wad), that comes with the original Doom, Doom2, Final Doom,
Ultimate Doom software.

We hope that this new version brings you a lot of enjoyment,
especially for the deathmatch fans out there.

Have much fun!!

<p>
Doom Legacy can run Doom, Boom, Heretic and Hexen maps. For each game, you
will need the corresponding IWAD file, which contains all graphics,
sounds, music in the game.<br/>
For example, if you want to play Doom II maps, you'll need the file "doom2.wad".
</p>

<h2><a name="basics">The basics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>

Installing Doom Legacy is extremely simple, just follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Unpack the archive</li>
<li>Start the Launcher</li>
<li>Fill in required information about WAD locations and hardware options</li>
<li>Launch the game!</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want, you can set the following environment variables to
have additional control over Legacy behaviour. None of them are
required.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The environment variable <b>DOOMWADDIR</b> defines the path where
the wad files are located. This way you can easily share you wad files
with different programs. By default, Legacy looks for wad files in the
current directory.
</li>
<li>The variable <b>USER</b>, containing your username, is used as the
default value for your player name in multiplayer games.</li>
<li>You home directory, defined by the variable <b>HOME</b>, will be
the place where Legacy stores your config and savegame files. By
default, they will be stored in the current directory.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="launcher">Launcher</a></h3>

<p>
The Launcher is a separate program, included in the Legacy
distribution, which provides the easiest way to start a Doom Legacy game.
Using it, you don't have to remember the command-line syntax.
Just use the mouse to select the game options you want and the
Launcher will start Legacy for you.
</p>


<h3><a name="cmdline">Command-line options</a></h3>

<p>Here are the command-line options Legacy recognizes:</p>


FIXME console commands cd, gr_stats, nodownload consvar

<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced features</a></h3>

<p>
Doom Legacy supports most of the cheats in the original
games. Additionally, we have added the cheats <b>idfly</b>
and <b>idcd</b>. With idfly, you can fly by pressing and holding the
jump button. idcd allows you to quickly change the cd music track
currently playing.

<h2><a name="editing">Editing</a></h2>

<h3><a name="legacyedit">Legacy editing features</a></h3>

<p>
Powerful editing features have long been one of Legacy's strongest points.
As of version 1.5, the Legacy game engine has been rewritten in
C++. During the rewrite, loads of new features were added to the game.

These documents are the current standard references to the inner
workings of Doom, Boom, Heretic and Hexen.
Although many of the limitations of the original games have been
lifted and new features have been added, they are still very useful
to a Legacy map editor.
