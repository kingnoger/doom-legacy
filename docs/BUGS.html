<h1>Doom Legacy bugs, unfinished stuff and excuses</h1>

<ul>
<li>Textures in the game are rendered incorrectly (software) or not at
all (hardware). Caused by the char->bool conversion in the video unit?
<li>Network code is only partially functional right now.
<li>FS is not up-to-date with the rest of the code. It should be
updated before re-enabling it.
<li>Serialization unit is unfinished, saving and loading is disabled.
<li>MAPINFO parser is disabled for now.
<li>Skins are disabled until an "Actor representation class" is designed. 
<li>Heretic inventory use has some bugs.
<li>Sometimes crashes when respawning after being killed by
a monster.
</ul>
