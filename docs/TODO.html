<h1>Doom Legacy TODO list</h1>

In order of decreasing importance:

<ul>
<li>Finish Hexen support. ANIMDEFS, intermission, polyobj
renderer, extra physics, weapon pieces, hub system.

<li>Finish Doom/Heretic linedef conversion to Hexen linedefs

<li>Default parameters to FS functions

<li>Fix the OpenGL T&amp;L system

<li>L2 caches
 <ul>
 <li>cache data in machine native byte order, so that it only needs to be
  changed once. patches for example.
 <li>cache graphics/sound only when needed, ie. when a thing is
  Spawned, cache it's sprite & sounds etc.
 <li>Texture/patch/flat -L2 cache that treats them all in the same way,
  using a Texture class, reference counting, SDL_surface?
 <li>Run the cache system in a separate thread;)
 </ul>

<li>a Texture class (static, animating, fractal, multitexturing...)

<li>New legacy.wad contents:
 <ul>
 <li>version string
 <li>a complete font (for console and menu)
 <li>title pictures, consback pictures
 <li>simple menu graphics
 <li>HUD overlay graphics
 <li>FS definition
 <li>a standard replacement texture, sound, music, sprite and model
 <li>SNDSEQ lump for Doom and Heretic sequences, maybe SNDINFO too
 <li>translation maps for Doom/Boom/Heretic linedefs (XDOOM, XHERETIC)
 <li>"Legacy demo" map in case someone decides to use it as an iwad
 + MAPINFO lump to handle it.
 </ul>

<li>Finish the OGG/MP3 music support

<li>Finish the MD3 renderer

<li>Serialization system (save/load)

<li>support for PAK, PK3(== zip) file formats, virtual file system for
 unpacked resources

<li>General team system, teamstarts etc.

<li>Game modifications using DLLs. Standard interface. CTF, Doom
  Fortress...

<li>More FS functions, better FS documentation, FS arrays

<li>A state/codepointer that runs FS/ACS

<li>AIPlayer-based bot system, bots implemented as DLLs.

<li>WAV sounds support

<li>Turn the Menu into a widget-based browser, including a levelgraph
  editor etc. Maybe replace the launcher altogether?

<li>a 3D skeleton-animated model class

<li>turn Console into a modern iostream-based class that can print
  strings etc. ( console &lt;&lt; "Hello world!" &lt;&lt; endl; )

<li>turn basic data types (mainly fixed_t) into classes with
  overloaded operators.

<li>A 3D vector template class? vect&lt;float&gt; p;?

<li>Other pawntypes besides Marine and Heretic
 <ul>
 <li>Natural attacks (and sounds) for each Pawntype (when Marines punch, Imps either
claw or shoot fireballs)
 <li>Viewheight depending on pawn height
 </ul>

<li>class Camera : public Actor could include chasecams,
  fixed cameras, target-following cams, IR cams etc.,
  some über-cool chasecam crosshair to make chasecam usable

<li>Advanced fault-resistant network code (like quake2, Unreal...)

<li>Enable cheating (for server only) in multiplayer games

<li>Sprite skin support, skin sounds

</ul>
