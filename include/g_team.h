/// Every single Actor in the game belongs to a team.
/// Some teams are always fixed, others can be created and destroyed.
/// Team 0 is always the "individual" team.
///   Fellow teammates are targeted and attacked if the Actor AI so demands.
///   In a DM game all players belong to team 0.
/// Team -1 is the "Hellspawn" team, in which all Doom creatures belong by default.
/// Team -2 is the "D'Sparil" team, in which all Heretic creatures belong by default.
/// Team -3 is the "Korax" team, in which all Hexen creatures belong by default.
///
/// This means that if you put Hellspawn and Heretic monsters in the same room, they will
/// attack each other unless they are specifically assigned to same team.
/// Team score is only kept for teams > 0.
