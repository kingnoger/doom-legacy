/*!
  OK. Doom map format is (undestandably) primitive and has no place for
  general information about maps. There are at least two ways to fix this:
 
  1)  MAPINFO lump (from Hexen and ZDoom)
      There can be one MAPINFO lump per wad. It is a text lump that consists of
      two kinds of blocks: MAP blocks and CLUSTERDEF blocks.
 
  2)  LevelInfo lumps (Legacy, others?)
      There is one LevelInfo lump per Map. It is the same lump as the
      mapname "separator", i.e. MAP16, E6M2, MYOWNMAP... 
      LevelInfo only contains info about the one map to which it belongs.
      It is a text lump that consists of blocks, such as [script], ...
 
  Internally, all the data for each map is combined into one class, MapInfo.
  It contains all the information regarding a Map that doesn't directly affect
  gameplay but can be of interest to human players, such as the Map
  name, author, recommendation for # of players, hints, music that is
  played during the map, partime etc.
